Welcome to Poke n Hope's official website!
</div>
<br>
<div class="body">
We have several sections now.
</div>
<br>
<div class="body">

</div>
<br>

</div>
<br>

</div>
<br>
<div class="body">
Last but not least, is the <a href="{% url 'recording1' %}">Archive</a> where you can review all matches recorded in the system.
</div>

<div class="body">
We would like to mention, in particular the Player Ranking page, a new measure which is commonly used in sporting competitions. We encourage you click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">here</a> for further details. It encompasses a ranking system that takes into account your opponent's level when calculating your ranking points. You will not be over-penalised/over-rewarded if you play a strong/lesser skilled player.

</div>
<br>
<div class="body">
The ranking points will not affect the final prize for this season. It only informs you of your relative level compared to others. If you think you're underrated in this ranking, the most efficient way to improve your points is by having more run outs.

</div>
<br>
<div class="body">
We have dedicated a lot of time on launching this website. We would be happy to see how these statistics can benefit you and your team.

</div>
<br>
<div class="body">
We are continually adding more features to this website.  Any suggestions or bug reporting are more than welcome.

</div>
<br>
<div class="body">
Thank you for your support and we hope together we can take this sport to the next level and create a global pool community where everyone is welcome! You can contact us at poke.n.hope.hk@gmail.com.

    We have to mention in particular on the Player Ranking page a new measure which is commonly used in sport competitions. We encourage you to go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"> here</a> for some documentation. But for those who hate numbers and formulas, we will explain why we have done so in simple words. Let's look at the following situations:
    <ul>
        <li>Imagine you play a good player and you are at the same level. Your opponent breaks and runs out the table. You get a 0:10. Then you break and run out as well. Both you and your opponent played excellent pool. But in the current total-points/average framework, you both would be penalized for getting 10 points in total in 2 frames. </li>
        <li>Now imagine you play a player much less skilled than you. You play bad and missed several shots but your opponent plays much better than her expected level. In the end, she still lost to you 7:10 and 7:10. In the current framework, you get 20 in two frames and it is perfect. You don't have to pay for your struggle.</li>
    </ul>
    But in the Ranking Points evaluation, it is different. In the first case, your ranking points will not be affected at all; in the second, your ranking points will decrease and also your opponent will be rewarded for pushing you to the edge.
